Project Layout
==============================

In an outliner view a project looks like this:

- Project (name)
    - Assets
        - Models (hidden if empty)
            - User Model 1
            ...
            - User Model n
        - Materials (hidden if empty)
            - User Material 1
            ...
            - User Material n
        - Textures (hidden if empty)
            - User Texture 1
            ...
            - User Texture n
        - File (hidden if empty)
            - User File 1
            ...
            - User File n
    - Packages
        - User Package 1
        ...
        - User Package n

Assets
------------------------------
Game component files or file groups that are built from source files with user
supplied settings. Each has type specific settings and method of building.
Individual assets have a build target but cannot be built outside of a package.
They contain:

Common parts:
- User supplied name for ease of recognition.
- User supplied description of the purpose it serves.
- Build target.
- Build methods
    - These will be type specific but each has one
- Internal ID for internal referencing (not user manipulated).
- Possibility of referencing another asset and creating a modified version of it
    - e.g. a model that adds an attachment
- Ability to build from presets.
    - Type specific operations though

File
- Source file that may or may not be the same name as the build target.

Texture
- Source data
    - Either an image file
    - or programmatic settings (e.g. single colour)
- .vtf compile settings

Material
- Selectable shader
    - Shaders have settings that need to be set
        - References Texture assets
        - or exisiting game textures
- Ability to

Model (probably the biggest jump from doing it manually)
- Source mesh(es)
- Source animation(s)
- Material groups
    - References Material assets
    - or existing game materials
- Attachments
- Other settings


Packages
------------------------------
In order to use Assets they must be added to a Package and the package has
to be built. A Package's settings are a list of related Assets with their
build targets set. An Asset in a package may reference an Asset in another
package. A full project might look like:
