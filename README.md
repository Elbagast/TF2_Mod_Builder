TF2 Mod Builder - in development
==============================
Goal: Application to manage the development, deployment and maintenance of mods for Source engine games, specifically Team Fortress 2.


Current progress:
- Window for a single open Project with menu bar that contains the use case discovered user actions.
- Saving and loading stand-in Project data.
- Outliner that gets modified as the data changes, and can change the data.
- Editor for individual sections of the Project, that update if the data changes elsewhere. 
- Editors can be opened and closed as needed via the Outliner.
- Section names have unique names that maintain uniqueness when edited.
- Rudimentary undo and redo behaviour that is in need of debugging.
